Journal Update from Vimal
This week we officially started with the Group Project related activities. We had two rounds of discussions this week, and selecting the project was the main topic of discussion. We brainstormed lots of ideas from CS Unplugged website. Few ideas were related to Binary Number Conversion, Searching, sorting etc. 
I would really like to stress on ‘See the Whole’ core value which I felt was taken care throughout the project related activities. When we were discussing about the game to select, even if we finalizing on a game, we tried to see the complete picture of the idea. Rather than just concentrating on the idea, we tried to visualize the game as a whole. Discussed about the challenges we will come across, how we can solve that, feasibility of multiplayer option, synchronization issues etc. By doing so we could narrow down most of challenges in the first place itself, which would be very beneficial from the project point of view. The early we know about the possible pitfalls, the more time will get to work on the same and fix the issues. Even from the requirements point of view, the concept of ‘See the Whole’ during the discussion has helped us to collect majority of the requirements during the discussion phase itself.
After finalizing the project idea, we decided on how we would implement the idea as a Learning and Game Interface to the students. Both of these things should be kept in mind while designing the project, as those are the key items that we deliver to our users. This has helped us to have an idea of infrastructure design and Data requirements because of the ‘See the Whole’ approach followed during the discussion phase. The same advantage can be propagated to next stages of development starting from design. By visualizing and discussing about the whole of the project, we could figure out the architectural concerns, design issues, and other technical issues that we may end up in. Because of this core value, we could figure a solution for the synchronization problem that we may face during the implementation. So by virtue of ‘See the Whole’ approach we were able to track down lot of issues and challenges that we might face later during our development cycle. This approach will definitely help us understand and solve the challenge before they happen. This will eventually facilitate a smooth development life cycle.
