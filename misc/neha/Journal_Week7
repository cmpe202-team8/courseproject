I continued to work on developing services for Binary Test. 
Fetching the questions of a particular difficulty like medium from database and presenting it to user in Binary Test. 
Also, capturing the response from user and saving value in database. 
Once the all the responses for a test/quiz is captured, the users score is calculated based on correct responses. After calculating the score,
rank is calculated and if his scores falls in best 10 scores, his score and username is displayed on Score board.
