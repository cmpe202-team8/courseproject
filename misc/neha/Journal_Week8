This week we met to integrate all the work we have done. We also distributed the documentation work and started preparing presentation
to be showed during project demo.
We have completed the project and integrated backend and UI modules.
In the coming weeks, we have decided to teach the Binary learning to non Computer Science background people and kids in the library.
This will not only prepare us for the project demo but also if there are any changes, 
we can also take care of that before our actual presentation.

By following the XP core value Simplicity, we have not only completed the project on time but have also made sure that we have also met 
all the client requirements.
