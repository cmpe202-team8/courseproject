CMPE 202
Journal week 3

As planned we had our weekly meeting on Wednesday. But since all were busy, we had to do an online meeting at night. The technologies have helped people to have effective communication even if we canâ€™t be present physically in a meeting.

Next meeting is planned on Friday. We could not meet on Friday, so we had a meeting after the Silicon Valley code camp.

Highlights for this week:
Decided to go forward with MEAN stack. 
Database side will be designed by Neha, Server side will be designed by Vimal and Rakesh and me and Vaish will work on the front-end.

My task:
The coming week we should find a good way of implementing the graphics required for the game.
