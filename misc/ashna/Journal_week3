CMPE 202
Journal week 3

As planned we had our weekly meeting on Wednesday. But since all were busy, we had to do an online meeting at night. The technologies have helped people to have effective communication even if we canâ€™t be present physically in a meeting.

Next meeting is planned on Friday.
