CMPE202Journal Week1	CS Unplugged is a collection of activities which were designed to teach school children computational thinking. This week we researched on some of the topics given in the website. The topics which I researched are Binary Numbers, which is an activity designed to teach binary to decimal conversions, Image representation which is a game designed to understand how images are displayed in a computer screen and Text Compression where we learn how to store a large amount of data in a small available space in computers.I would like to discuss about the core Kanban Principle, Communication. Our team met twice this week. During the first meeting, we created the github repository for the project, created waffle task board and cloned the CFD sheet to google drive. During the second meeting we also discussed the topics which we discussed and chose Binary Number representation as the topic. I feel that were able to communicate to each other and all the team members participated well. We were able to discuss and agree about the project topic quickly. We have also decided to continue having the weekly meetings. We have also created a group in slack to communicate with each other.After agreeing to go forward with the topic Binary Numbers for our project, we discussed and created tasks and also assigned the tasks to the team members. The tasks are also updated in waffle and CFD sheet. I am assigned to the task how to teach binary to decimal conversion in an interactive online web page. We have decided that we will have an option to learn the binary conversion before starting the game. I am working on creating an interactive and interesting way of doing this.
