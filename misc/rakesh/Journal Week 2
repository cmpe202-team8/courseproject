Core Value: Feedback:
====================

In the first week all of us decided to investigate on one aspect of the project.
After individual research work, this week we shared our views with the whole team.
All the ideas went through the peer review system and we came across very nice points.
Once we all collided with each other's ideas all the small pieces started 
merging togther.

My work was to anaylyse the back-end requirements and come up with the use cases.
I have conceived the back-end architecture and come up with a generic frameowork.
From the back-end persepctive I was having a certain view of  the 
multi-player synchronisation scenario.When I placed the idea on the table, all the other
team-members provided progressive feedbacks which really helped me in concieving the
correct architecture.

This way, work done by most of the team-members' was alleviated due to a strong and critical
discussion sessions we had.It helped us viewing the whole system hollistically and 
come up with the whole game-flow with much ease. The discussions also helped us coming
up with a flow based on user-perspective, not developer-perspective.

Overall, the productivity of our team has been progressive due to the feed-back based
discussion sessions.
