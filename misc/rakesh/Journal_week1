Tasks Achieved:
- Back-end Requirement Gathering
- Use Casess for back-end involvement
- Back-end architecture conceving

Value Chosed (Communication):
- Working in silos is a big blocker for the success of any team. 
  In order to break that we need open communication and frequent meetings. 
  We have set-up a slack channel as well as a social media mechanism to keep communicating our ideas, progress and blockers.
  Additionally we are meeting minimum twice a week to check of we are on target. If not, we re-adjust our goals or time-to-invest or
  priorities etc.
