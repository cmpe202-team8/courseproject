Journal entry for week 3

Courage: This week was mostly setting up project structures, skeleton code setup. We also planned to use the heroku application and directly linked up our github project with it. This enables us to view continuously built and pushed changes live at https://<appname>.herokuapp.com. Whenever there are breaking changes, the heroku server doesn't push the changes to the server and keeps the old built. Thus any breaking changes doesn't break the prod servers.

A lot of discussion was done and everybody on the team showed lot of courage in selecting the right technologies at all levels. The various levels are UI - where we discussed about the new UI kits that are very responsive, Backend - NodeJS with express JS as the rest framework. This enables us to easy creation of rest apis that can be consumed at on any device. For DB we have decided to go with Mlab as we want auto scale of DB which will be a good way to have no effect on server performance. Also using MongoDB we have faster query execution. The mongodb also returns data in the form of JSON notation. This being the Javascript object notation, it will be easier to work with javascript backed. Ultimately it was decided that me and Ashna will be working on front end while Rakesh, Vimal and Neha will be working on back end. A lot of discussions led to these important decisions. Also, everybody in the team maintained good grounds and had fruitful discussions.
