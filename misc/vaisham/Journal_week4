Journal entry for week 4
Core Value Courage: 
This week was mostly oriented towards pocs, basics setups and other components. Me and Ashna kick started on UI developement. One of the most influential designs in UI is material design by google. There a lot of guidelines defined by google on UI elements, kits, colors, icons, responsiveness of the controls etc. There were many third party vendors providing UI kits satisfying or addressing all these guidelines. More or less almost all the components are covered. One of the prominent UI Kits is https://www.materializecss.com. This is an open source tool kit. Another one we also considered was bootstrap paper theme by bootswatch. But due to the high poularity and the high user base we went with materializecss. This materialize CSS also is part of CDN so that we can directly use the clouds urls for the webpages and not explicity saving them to our project folder, thus saving valuable network bandwidth of the deployed server.

All these days in the week we maintained very good rapport with the team and discussed about various UI designs and POCs of the important components in the UI desings. All the time everybody in the team maintained courage and implemented dutifully whatever they were intended to do. Vimal, Neha and Rakesh worked comparitive studies of various components of backend. They were discussing the pros and cons of using SQLl vs NoSQL database for our project.
