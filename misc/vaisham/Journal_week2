After a long discussion, we finally nailed down to a scenario in which the game is played. The scenario is as follows,

Single player:

start the game. you will be logged in already. (A way can be to have user not logged in play
but they give their names at the end of the game.) A time period or 3(short) 5(medium) 10(long) 
minutes be selected for the games. Based on the selection the questions will be issued from the
question bank. A person can solve as many questions as he can in that time.

The following things can be calculated from that:
a. No of questions answered
b. Average time for each question
c. Accuracy for all the questions answered


Multi player:

start the game by invoking our multiplayer option. A 8 character secret code is generated. This
can be used to start the game by all the users when playing the game. Everybody will start the 
game by entering hte code. This is again based on time (3, 5, 10 minutes). The scores here will
be shared at the end of the game.
