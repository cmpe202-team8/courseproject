Respect:

A lot of us where unknown to each other before forming a team. We had good communication along with respect to each other's opinions inorder to build a game.
Members of my team have varying amounts of experience. From 8 years to 18 months. Inspite this everybody in the team where able to express their opinions regarding the project, ideas, features etc.

Not only this, while we were brainstorming in two of our meetings we had sessions where people were refuting against each other regarding various features of the selected game. This helped break the ice of forming a new team and the end outcome was an team wide accepted set of beliefs and decisions. After these two meetings all team members were on the right track and everybody understood the in and outs of all the decisions we have come to in the first week. What I liked most is that, highly experienced members of the team were ready to listen to the other people clearly.
